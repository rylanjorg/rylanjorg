  <summary><h2> üó£Ô∏è More About Me </h2></summary>
  My coding + game design journey kicked off during my middle school years as I became more acquainted with technology (and computer games). Being intrigued by my technology and computer science classes throughout middle and high school, I decided to major in computer science with a focus on game and simulation development at Grand Canyon University. During my university years, I also played on the varsity esports team, on which I received a scholarship to captain my school's team through several collegiate leagues. In addition to creating many small game projects using Unity, I also honed my computer science skills both in class and on my own through the creation of tools and experimentation. During this time I was also able to obtain a certification through Google for IT Automation using Python. Now, I'm on the lookout for exciting opportunities in software development and particularly the gaming industry.
